## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI refers to a set of techniques that enable computers to mimic human behavior.

## Machine Learning (ML)

ML is a subfield of AI, which enables machines to learn and make predictions based on data.

    (Data + Desired Output) --> [Training] --> [Model] --> (Output)

Trains algorithms to learn from data to make predictions without being programming

### Supervised Learning:
> Requires labeled data

@ Example:
- Object Recognition (Regression + Classification)


#### Classification
- Support vector machines
- Decision Trees
- Random forests
- K-nearest neighbor
- **Neural Networks**

@ Example:
- Spam Detection
- Face Recognition

#### Regression
- Linear
- Generalized linear
- Gaussian process
- **Neural Networks**

@ Example: 
- Housing Price
- Happiness vs Income

### Unsupervised Learning:
> No labels provided**

#### Clustering
- K-means
- Spectral clustering

#### Dimensionality reduction
- PCA
- Autoencoder
- Self-organizing maps
- Diffusion maps

### Semi-supervised Learning:
> Uses a small labelled dataset with a much larger unlabeled dataset

#### Generative model
- **GPT**
- **GAN**
- **VAE**
- **Diffusion Models**

#### Reinforcement Learning
- Q-Learning
- Markov decision process
- **Deep reinforcement learning**

### Self-supervised Learning:
> Utilizes unlabeled data but creates its own pseudo-labels 

### Reinforcement Learning:
> The model interacts with an environment through trial and error

## Neural Networks (NN)

NN are a subfield of ML that use artificial neural networks to extract patterns from data, inspired by the human brain.

## Deep Learning (DL)

DL is a subfield of NN that utilizes multi-layered neural networks to achieve high performance on complex tasks.
